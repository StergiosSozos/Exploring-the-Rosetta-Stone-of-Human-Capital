# Exploring-the-Rosetta-Stone-of-Human-Capital
In this assignment I will work on the working paper A Rosetta Stone of Human Capital, by Dev Patel and Justin Sandefur. 

As you may know, there are different tests that measure reading and writing skills at school among countries in the world. The problem is that not all countries use the same tests. The basic contribution of the authors was to come up with a way to facilitate conversion between test scores in different countries. In this way they have created what they call a "Rosetta Stone of Human Capital", because it allows us to compare human capital across the different countries.
In this notebook I will replicate some of their findings using python Pandas, Numpy,scipy and Statsmodels.
